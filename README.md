# About the Author
I am currently a junior at Shakopee High School. I took the computer science class to explore the science and technology field more. I have really enjoyed using what I learned to create this website.  

# About the Website
This website was made using HTML, PHP, and CSS.
I made this website to figure out the most popular car that people drive. The website takes the users name, car brand, and age and puts it into a table. You can look through the different car brand tables to determine the amount of people who own that vehicle. The website also contains a lot of color and different fonts that allow for a more appealing look. The website also allows you to delete entrys if a mistake was made.
