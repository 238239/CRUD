By: Adam Olson

## About the Author
I am currently a junior at Shakopee High School. I took the computer science class to explore the science and technology field more. I have really enjoyed using what I learned to create this website.  

## About the Website
I made this website to figure out the most popular car that people drive. The website takes the users name, car brand, and age and puts it into a table. You can look through the different car brand tables to determine the amount of people who own that vehicle. The website also contains a lot of color and different fonts that allow for a more appealing look. The website also allows you to delete entrys if a mistake was made.

## How the Website was Made
This website was made using a HTML template. The template then took the code from the PHP and CSS files to created the website. The PHP files contained all the code to make the website work and the CSS files developed the visual side of the code.
